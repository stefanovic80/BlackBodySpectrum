# BlackBodySpectrum
If you want to know what a black body is in physics, just have a look here
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation
Many different light sources has a black body spectral shape. The sun is one of them.
Black body spectrum is mainly characterized by the socalled "color temperature", which is
a parameter expressed in Kelvin (K). Back to the sun, it's radiation color temperature is 
about 6000 Kelvin, which is also the temperature of its external surface.
Also light bulbs you find in a store are characterized not only by their emission luminosity
but also by their color temperature
In the plot provided here, many black body spectra at different temperatures are provided.
You can clearly see that increasing the color temperature, which is the some as the source
temperature, the spectral peak position moves to shorter wavelengths, which are the socalled 
"cold lights".
While dropping down the color temperature, light concentrate more on the longer wavelengths,
which are known as "hot lights"
